Note: I didn't include "rule of 5" other such stuff (rule of 3, 7) because I thought it would just clutter things. But I would assure you I know what they are.

Unit tests - marshalling this package to use a test framework would involve reading a make utility (cmake, etc) and I have no guarantee you have this installed. This set, I wrote some tests that assume gtest is installled properly and chose to use cmake.

Unit Tests Part II - after discussion, the suggestion was to just write some pseudocode for unit tests. 
I have accordingly added some code that would work but commented it out.
