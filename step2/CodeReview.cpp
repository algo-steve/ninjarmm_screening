/* Review:

This exercise asks me to review code as I would in reality. Usually, I review code on a PR so this is a little unusual.
I also do not normally change a lot of code (beyond obvious stuff like descriptions/typos) without the submitter's 
input, so this is also unusual for me. But I believe the objective here is to just get a general style on what I'm
like to work with and to understand my judgement. With that said, I'll do my best by:

1. Adding comments where necessary.
2. Change code only when obvious.
3. Giving my opinons where warranted.

I should note that I haven't done much work with microsoft windows apis lately. So my familiarity 
is a bit rusty. But I believe the contents should have merit regardless.
